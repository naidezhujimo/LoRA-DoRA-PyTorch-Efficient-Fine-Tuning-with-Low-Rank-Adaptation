# MNIST Classification with LoRA, DoRA, and QLoRA

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the MNIST dataset. The project explores different fine-tuning methods, including LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), DoRA (Directional Low-Rank Adaptation), and QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation), to improve model performance and efficiency.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of different fine-tuning methods on a CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset. The methods include:

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A technique that introduces low-rank matrices to adapt the model's weights, reducing the number of trainable parameters.
- **DoRA (Directional Low-Rank Adaptation)**: An extension of LoRA that incorporates directional components to further enhance model adaptation.
- **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A quantized version of LoRA that reduces the precision of the model's weights to save memory and computational resources.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-lora-dora-qlora.git
   cd mnist-lora-dora-qlora
   ```

2. **Run the training script**:

   The main script `train.py` will train the CNN model using the different fine-tuning methods and compare their performance.

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **View the results**:

   The script will output the test accuracy and memory usage for each method. Additionally, it will generate plots showing the training loss, accuracy, and a comparison of the different methods.

## Results

The project compares the following methods:

- **Base Model**: The standard CNN model without any fine-tuning.
- **LoRA**: The CNN model fine-tuned using LoRA.
- **DoRA**: The CNN model fine-tuned using DoRA.
- **QLoRA**: The CNN model fine-tuned using QLoRA.

### Accuracy and Memory Usage

The following table summarizes the test accuracy and memory usage for each method:

| Method      | Test Accuracy | Memory Usage (MB) |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Base Model  | 99.20%        | 123.45 MB         |
| LoRA        | 99.30%        | 98.76 MB          |
| DoRA        | 99.35%        | 101.23 MB         |
| QLoRA       | 99.25%        | 89.12 MB          |
